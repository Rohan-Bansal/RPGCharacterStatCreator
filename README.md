# RPGCharacterStatCreator
A java program to generate a D&amp;D character and return a filled out pdf form.

Project may/may not be optimized soon due to dependency problems. Still works though!

## Features

- Asks for information, automatically fills out the stat sheet
- Can randomly generate fields
- After program finishes, print sheet

### How to use

- Download the jar file, place the character sheet in the same directory
- Run the jar file via terminal
- Remember to ONLY use the character sheet form provided. If not, there is a 50% chance of program error.
